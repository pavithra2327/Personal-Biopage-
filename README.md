# Personal-Biopage-

The first HTML project on our list is a simple Bio Page to list your personal information.

This is great for beginners because it introduces you to the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS, including:

Basic HTML structure: You’ll create the skeleton of an HTML document via doctype, html, head, and body tags. We’ll even use HTML5 sections.
HTML tags: You’ll use headers, paragraphs, images, and anchor tags to display content.
CSS styling: You’ll apply styles to HTML elements, like changing fonts, colors, and adding spacing.
